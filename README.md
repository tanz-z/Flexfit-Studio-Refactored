# FlexFit Studio

Class booking and membership management for a single gym site. Members book classes, buy memberships and spend class credits. Staff run the front desk, manage trainers and pull reports. Companies buy credit pools their employees book against.

## Requirements

Node 20 or newer, and pnpm. If you don't have pnpm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

The database is SQLite and lives in a file. There's no server to install and no account to create.

## Getting set up

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm db:push
pnpm db:seed
pnpm dev
```

That gets you a populated studio at http://localhost:3000 with a couple of weeks of classes either side of today.

`db:push` creates `flexfit.db` and applies the schema. `db:seed` fills it with sample members, plans, classes and bookings.

## Signing in

| Role    | Email                  | Password   |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |
| Admin   | admin@flexfit.test     | admin123   |
| Trainer | arjun@flexfit.test     | trainer123 |
| Member  | rahul.k@example.com    | member123  |

Every seeded member uses `member123`. The other member emails are in `src/db/seed.ts`.

## Commands

| Command         | What it does                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`      | Development server on port 3000                    |
| `pnpm build`    | Production build                                   |
| `pnpm db:push`  | Apply the schema in `src/db/schema.ts`             |
| `pnpm db:seed`  | Wipe the data and reseed                           |
| `pnpm db:reset` | Delete the database file, then push and seed again |

`db:reset` is the one you want when the data gets into a state you don't like. It's destructive and it's meant to be.

## Two things that will waste your time

Don't run `pnpm build` while `pnpm dev` is running. The build writes over the directory the dev server is using and the app starts throwing `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. Nothing is actually broken. Stop the dev server, delete `.next`, start it again. If you want to typecheck while the server is up, use `npx tsc --noEmit` instead.

If you're changing anything in `src/db/schema.ts`, run `pnpm db:push` afterwards or the app and the database will disagree with each other in confusing ways.

## Layout

  app/              routes and pages
  components/
    features/       page-specific UI (dashboard, trainer)
  db/               schema, client, seed data
  lib/              client-side helpers

    lib/            shared server utilities and constants
    services/       business logic (bookings, reschedules, corporate)
